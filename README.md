# AirBnb-Bookings-Analysis-EDA-project


### *Objective*
The business's objective in this project is to discover key insights through exploratory data analysis about factors that influence the price of listings and Airbnb bookings in New York, and the results of this information will be useful in making business decisions.


### *Project Summary*

Airbnb (Air Bed and Breakfast) is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales. Airbnb makes the bulk of its revenue by charging a service fee for each booking. We have the AirBnB NYC 2019 dataset with us. Which has around 49,000 observations for 16 different features. In-depth analysis of this dataset has been done. The process involved cleaning and organising the dataset by handling missing values and outliers to prepare it for EDA.This process ensured that the data was error-free and ready for visualization. For visualization, a proper structure has been followed: first, univariate analysis has been performed, followed by bivariate and multivariate analysis. Through analysis, we will try to find variation in the data and explore the distribution and trend of numerical and categorical features using different kinds of plots.In this analysis, price is an important factor, and the relationship of price with other fetures will be discovered and this information will be helpful in making  business decisions.Following are a few questions that we aim to answer through our analysis:

* What are the various types of properties that are available for rent?
* Which neighbourhood group is most popular and why?
* What are the factors that affect price in NYC? 
* How do the prices of listings vary according to location?
* Which location is most preferred for spending the night?
* What can we learn about different hosts and which hosts are most popular and why?
